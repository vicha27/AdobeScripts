The purpose of this repository is to just have Adobe Scripts saved in case I lose access to my current scripts and need backups.

Feel free to use them if you find them. Aside from learning my Directory information, there is not much personal information to gain.

You can use "AdobeRemoveWhite" to remove the white from black images, but be warned that there is a stopper that allows you to manually click "IgnoreWhite" in the image tracing options.

I tried receiving help to allow me to just run the script completely through, but Adobe was of no help.

As for the second file, "ConvertPNGtoDXFandEPS", well it's exactly what it sounds like.
